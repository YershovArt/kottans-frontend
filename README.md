####  MARKDOWN 
It is my first try using **markdown**. 
In order to learn, share progress and impressions i decided to use **markdown** .

####  Introduction to Git and GitHub.
+ Looked throught first two weeks of introduction to Git and GitHub course.
+ + I have never used Linux terminal  and VCS beafore. 
+ + Remote VCS helps people all over the world to create effective collaboration.
+ + It is very important to know how to use VCS corretly. That is why i will practise in it.
+ Walked throught [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org:) 
+ + This exersise strengthened my knowladges  in VCS branches.
 Made my first pull request 
+ + Forking first time in my life, at the beginning i had no clue what is it.
+ + Now i know that if you want to change something in the remote repository, 
at first you should copy it to your repo by forking ,make changes (locally or remotely), after that create pull request.
I made it throught the terminal. 
+ + Pull requests is very important part in collaborative working. I will always use it in my career, study etc.
